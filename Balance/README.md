Balance Dataset
===============

A public data set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations of human balance ([http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.47671](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.47671)).  

The quantitative evaluation was performed by stabilography (posturography) using a force platform.  
We evaluated subjects during standing still for 60 s in four different conditions where vision and the standing surface were manipulated: eyes open on a rigid surface; eyes closed on a rigid surface; eyes open on an unstable surface; eyes closed on an unstable surface. Each condition was performed three times and the order of the conditions was randomized among subjects.  
The following qualitative tests were employed: Short Falls Efficacy Scale International; International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Version; Trail Making Test; and Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Tests. The subjects were also interviewed to collect information about their sociocultural, demographic, and health characteristics.
