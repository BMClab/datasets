Balance Dataset
===============

A public data set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations of human balance (Santos & Duarte, in preparation).  

The quantitative evaluation was performed by stabilography (posturography) using a force platform. We evaluated subjects during standing still for 60 s in four different conditions where vision and the standing surface were manipulated: eyes open on a rigid surface; eyes closed on a rigid surface; eyes open on an unstable surface; eyes closed on an unstable surface. Each condition was performed three times and the order of the conditions was randomized among subjects. The following qualitative tests were employed: Short Falls Efficacy Scale International; International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Version; Trail Making Test; and Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Tests. The subjects were also interviewed to collect information about their sociocultural, demographic, and health characteristics.  

The data set comprises signals from the force platform (raw data for the force, moments of forces, and centers of pressure) of 231 subjects (2742 files in ASCII format with space-separated columns) plus one file with information about the subjects and balance conditions and the results of the qualitative evaluations.
