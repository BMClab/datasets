PDS: Posture Data Set
====================

This data set comprises signals from two force platforms (raw data for the force, moments of forces, and center of pressure) and the full-body three-dimensional kinematics of 49 subjects plus one file with meta data about the subjects and balance conditions and the results. 

The data set is available at Figshare (DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.4525082](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4525082)) and described in the companion paper [Santos DA, Fukuchi CA, Fukuchi RK, Duarte M. (2017)]().
